![Final Score](https://i.ibb.co/fBtNwQS/image.png)

## Project Description
The `CPP Module 04` introduces deeper concepts of polymorphism with abstract classes and interfaces. This module focuses on understanding how to design flexible and extensible software architectures using abstract base classes and pure virtual functions.

## Journey
This module was a fascinating exploration into advanced polymorphism techniques. I successfully completed it on my first attempt, applying abstract class principles effectively and reinforcing my knowledge of object-oriented programming.

## Key Learnings
- Implementing abstract base classes
- Understanding and using pure virtual functions
- Designing flexible and extensible object-oriented architectures
- Proper use of dynamic binding and virtual destructors

## Technical Details
- Developed an abstract class system to model real-world scenarios.
- Used pure virtual functions to enforce specific behavior in derived classes.
- Ensured correct memory management with virtual destructors.

## Project Status
- **First Attempt**: Success
- **Completion Time**: 1 day per module

## Challenges Faced
- Ensuring proper implementation of pure virtual functions.
- Managing object slicing and dynamic binding correctly.
- Designing interfaces that provide flexibility while maintaining structure.

## Reflection
This module significantly enhanced my understanding of abstraction in C++. Learning how to create flexible architectures using abstract classes and interfaces will be invaluable in designing scalable and maintainable software.

## Skills Developed
- Abstract class design and implementation
- Effective use of pure virtual functions
- Dynamic binding and memory management
- Designing extensible and maintainable code structures
- Advanced object-oriented programming concepts
